The supplementary material to this submission contains two different files.

1. mwe-sentiment-views.txt

This file contains the goldstandard sentiment-view annotation of multiword expressions.
Each line represents an entry for a multiword expression. A line contains three columns, the first being the multiword expression, the second being the sentiment view it conveys and the third being the polarity.


2. opinion-holder-annotation.xml

This file contains the annotation of opinion holders evoked by multiword expressions.

The format for annotating opinion holders mainly follows that of the GESTALT-shared task on source and target extraction (Ruppenhofer et al., 2014) which is a modification of the MPQA-annotation scheme (Wiebe et al., 2005).
For the sake of completenes, the file also contains the annotation of opinion targets in addition to that of opinion holders (even though only opinion holders were addressed in the paper).


The file is in SalsaTigerXML format (Erk & Padó, 2004).
Files in this format can be both visualized and edited with SALTO (the SALSA tool).
The tool along a Java API for navigating and modifying files in this format are available under:
